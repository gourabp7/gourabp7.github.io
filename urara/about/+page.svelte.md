Hi, my name’s Gourab and I’m a PhD Student at the Department of Computational Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. My research focusses on developing hardware-aware computational algorithms and novel implementation procedures for accelerating large-scale eigenvalue problems on heterogenous architectures and further accelerating these problems by developing communication avoidance procedures. These problems arise in quantum modeling of materials and are solved on extreme-scaling computing architectures using finite element discretization of Kohn-Sham density functional theory equations.

## Education

**_B.Sc. (Research) in Physics (First Class)_** <br>
**Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore**

Studied Non-Hermitian PT-Symmetric Quantum Hamiltonian models used to describe nonequilibrium steady states of dissipative quantum systems. Bachelors Thesis titled “_Orbital Effect of Magnetic Field on a Current Driven System_” under Prof. Sumilan Banerjee.

**_M.S. in Physics_** <br>
**Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore**

Implementated a time-dependent density functional theory module in an in-house python port of quantum espresso and applying it to study the response or the induced polarization when a time-dependent electric field is applied to a system. Masters Thesis titled “_Time-dependent Density Functional Theory_” under Prof. Manish Jain.

## Experience

**_Project Associate_** <br>
**MATRIX Lab, Computational Data Sciences, IISc**

Developed hardware-aware computational algorithms based on the matrix-free paradigm to evaluate on-the-fly finite-element discretized matrix-multivector products arising in solving the DFT problem without storing the cell-level matrices or the global sparse matrix.
