Hi, my name’s Gourab and I’m a PhD Student at the Department of Computational Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. My research focusses on developing hardware-aware computational algorithms and novel implementation procedures for accelerating large-scale eigenvalue problems on heterogenous architectures and further accelerating these problems by developing communication avoidance procedures. These problems arise in quantum modeling of materials and are solved on extreme-scaling computing architectures using finite element discretization of Kohn-Sham density functional theory equations.

## Experience

**_Project Associate_** (2020-2021) <br>
**MATRIX Lab, Department of Computational Data Sciences, IISc**

Developed hardware-aware computational algorithms based on the matrix-free paradigm to evaluate on-the-fly finite-element discretized matrix-multivector products arising in solving the DFT problem without storing the cell-level matrices or the global sparse matrix.

DFT-FE (C++/CUDA/MPI) is a massively parallel finite-element based open-source code for material modeling using density functional theory (DFT). DFT-FE can handle periodic, non-periodic and semi-periodic calculations. It can further handle both pseudopotential (ONCV, Troullier-Martins) and all-electron (non-relativistic) calculations; XC functionals supported are LDA, GGA (including spin-polarized); Capabilities include ground-state calculations, structural relaxations (ionic, cell), ab-initio MD (NVE). Scalability tested on ~200,000 MPI tasks on many-core architectures and ~64,000 GPUs on hybrid CPU-GPU architectures.
